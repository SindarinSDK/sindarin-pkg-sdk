# ==============================================================================
# sdk/time/time.sn - Time Type for Sindarin
# ==============================================================================
# Provides a time type with date/time operations.
# Drop-in replacement for the builtin Time type.
#
# Usage:
#   import "sdk/time/time"
#
#   var now: Time = Time.now()
#   print($"Year: {now.year()}\n")
#   print($"Hour: {now.hour()}\n")
#   print($"ISO: {now.toIso()}\n")
#
#   var later: Time = now.addHours(2)
#   var diff: long = later.diff(now)
#

# Time Native Struct Definition

# Uses @alias to map Time to RtTime in the runtime.
# The 'as ref' modifier means native methods receive self by pointer.
# Time represents an opaque handle type (like built-in Time).
